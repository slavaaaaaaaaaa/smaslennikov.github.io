Cheese sentience being such a hot topic recently, I figured I'd present some ice-breakers for these unavoidable meetings.

* Why so blue?
* Looking sharp today!
* I know you're Gouda, but how are you?
* We've got black and earl gray, would you like to Havarti?
* Hit the road, Jack!
* So you're telling me Frankenstein made a Muenster out of you?

More to come!
