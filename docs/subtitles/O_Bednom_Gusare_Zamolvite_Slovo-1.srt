1
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:48,738
The story that we're about to present does not rely on facts

2
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,420
It is so unlikely, that it's impossible not to believe it

3
00:02:54,931 --> 00:03:02,171
It happens in that amazing time when
men worked a sabre better than grammar...

4
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,540
...and went without fear not only into war, but also into marriage,...

5
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:14,898
...when women knew how to value selfless love and
rewarded it with dowry,...

6
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:26,242
...when clothes were so beautiful, and figures so perfect,
that the first wasn't shameful to put on the second.

7
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:35,598
It was the time when the czar loved his people,
and the people paid him with the same,...

8
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,198
...well, and also with many other things.

9
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:47,264
It was the time when the best minds thought,
but kept quiet, because their mouths were forced shut,...

10
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:53,593
...and the worst, talked.
Even though, they could've kept quiet.

11
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:56,837
Well, maybe, everything wasn't like that.

12
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:04,848
If one thought about it, our story - is a tale,
barely touched up with truth.

13
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,269
And if one didn't think about it, even more so!

14
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,824
Allow me to introduce: his majesty, count Merzlyaev.

15
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:03,358
- What's there?...

16
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,275
...ah, it's nothing.

17
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:12,099
Count Merzlyaev, clerk for Special Orders
of the Imperial Court...

18
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:14,586
...actual secret adviser.

19
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:16,984
In one word, an influential person.

20
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,671
He really is an "actual" person,
and, between the two of us, in some things, secret.

21
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:30,653
Here is his valet, his coachman, his lackey,
his horses, his coach. In one word, mobile estate.

22
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:44,651
[coachman]: Prrr, slow down!

23
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,251
- Your majesty, in ten minutes the breakfast will be ready

24
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,961
- Thank you, Egorych

25
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,333
- Why don't you give me the pistols, darling

26
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,008
- Please

27
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,656
- What's he shooting for?

28
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:22,017
- Shooting! He's thinking! His majesty always shoots when
he thinks. During that time, he thinks of the best thoughts

29
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:24,327
- Are we coming to Gubernsk for long?

30
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,927
- As soon as we finish our work, we'll leave

31
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:26,591
- Egorych!

32
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:27,220
- Yes, as you say!

33
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,161
- Go stand over by that linden

34
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:31,352
- Your majesty, that's not a linden, that's an oak

35
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,142
- Yeah? Looks like a linden

36
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,599
- Turn towards me

37
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:38,727
- Like this?

38
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:51,286
- Yeah... the mug is that of a mongrel..
well, if we clothe you, powder you... yeah.

39
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:56,317
- And now, yell loudly,
"Satrap!"

40
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,229
- Your majesty, in what way?

41
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:03,185
- Well, it means, tirant, executioner, murderer. Yell!

42
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:03,924
- To whom?

43
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:05,023
- To me!

44
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:08,942
- Your majesty! I apologize for the words, but
how are you a satrap?

45
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,563
- You're my birthfather! [not literally]

46
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,568
- Yeah, keep talking. Do what you're told!

47
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:13,765
- Satrap.

48
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:15,805
- Louder.

49
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:16,994
- Satrap

50
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,188
- Don't worry! Louder!

51
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:19,454
- Satrap.

52
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:26,705
- Artyuhov, imagine that you're a conspirator,
a rebel. A foe to the Czar, betrayer of fatherland.

53
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:27,234
- Me?

54
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:27,503
- Yes.

55
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:30,008
- Your majesty, after so many years of faith and truth, and you..!

56
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:31,402
- No discussions!

57
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:36,223
- Satrap! Murderer! Executioner!

58
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:42,461
- So! And now, darling, fall as if you were knocked down.

59
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:45,773
- Now!

60
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,184
- I apologize, your majesty, legs aren't obeying!
